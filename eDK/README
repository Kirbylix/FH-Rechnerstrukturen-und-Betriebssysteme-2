### eJVM Development Kit ###

Command line tools to compile and execute programs written in the Java-esque Educational Virtual Machine Language (eJVM).

Contents:
	- antlr: Contains eJVM grammar for ANTLR4 and parser generation script (generate_parser.bat).
	- bin: Contains compiled eDK and scripts to invoke compiler (ejvmc), interpreter (ejvm) and disassembler (ejvmdump) for Microsoft Windows and Linux.
	- doc: Contains JavaDoc documentation of the public API (e.g. to embed the interpreter into another program).
	- examples: Contains example eJVM programs.
		- test.ejvm: Test program to test eJVM features.
	- lib: Contains libraries needed to run (and compile) the eJVM tools (as well as their respective licenses).
	- scripts: Contains the scripts also found in bin (they are copied into bin when the project is build).
	- src: Contains the eDK Java source code.
	- eJVM Programming Language Specification.pdf: Official specification of the eJVM language. Describes syntax, available instructions and the format of the executable files generated by the eJVM compiler.
	- LICENSE: License for the eDK source code (MIT license).
	- README: This file.
	- build.xml: Build file for Apache Ant.

Usage:
	- Make sure Java (version >= 7) is installed. On Microsoft Windows, make sure JAVA_HOME is set to point to the base directory of your Java installation.
	- Compile eJVM source code: ejvmc Source.ejvm
	- Execute eJVM programs: ejvm Program.exf
	- Disassemble existing programs: ejvmdump Program.exf
	- The Project Documentation.pdf file includes examples on how to embed the compiler and/or interpreter into another Java application (section 3.5).
